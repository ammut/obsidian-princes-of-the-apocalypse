This is a write-up of the things we did, the sights we saw, the treasures we found and the people we met during our campaign as Eldon, Grom, Kareen, Sun and Vess.

## Styleguide

- Try to keep duplication or repetition low!
- Articles in 'Sessions' are meant to be a chronological history of our adventures, where you'll write like: "First X happened, then Y happened, etc.,"
- Articles in 'People', 'Locations', 'Organizations', 'Items' are meant to be a sort of 'encyclopedia' or reference index - a rather narrow list of facts directly related to the article's subject. That means:
  - In 'People' articles, try to focus on the things that were relevant for *their* character development, from *their* point of view. Try not to repeat everything that happened in every involved person's article.
- That obviously means there will be a lot of duplication between 'Sessions' and the 'reference' folders, which is fine. The goal is to not have it inside the 'reference' folders.
